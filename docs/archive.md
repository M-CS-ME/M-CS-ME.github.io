Bunch of my work that I think are worth sharing on the internet. Though I had
to lower my standards upon realizing how little material of such quality I've
created.

1. [Lambda Calculus Notes](archive/lambda-notes.pdf). My notes from the UofT
mentorship program about the lambda-calculus. Still needs some polishing and I
also intend to make a lambda-calculus interpreter for this by using the 
definitions.

2. [Lambda Calculus Presentation](archive/lambda-pres.pdf). The presentation I
gave at for the UofT mentorship program.

3. [Fibonacci Triangle Problem](archive/fib-triangle.pdf). My solution to an 
interesting number theory (?) problem involving a triangle of fibonacci 
numbers.
