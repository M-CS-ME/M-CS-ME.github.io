## Groups

%{(Problem)}% Show that the left cosets generated by $H \subseteq G$ partition $G.$
Show that the right cosets generated by $H$ also partition $G.$ 

%{(Theorem)}% *(Lagrange's theorem).* The order of a group $G$ is equal to the product of the order
of $H \subseteq G$ and the number of the cosets generated by $H.$

%{(Problem)}% Prove Lagrange's theorem.

%{(Problem)}% Find all groups of order $2, 3.$ Prove that all groups
of prime order are cyclic.

%{(Problem)}% *Find all groups of order $4$ and $6.$

%{(Definition)}% The *commutator* of two elements $a,b$ of the group $G$ is 
given by $aba^{-1}b^{-1}.$ The *commutant* $K(G)$ is defined to be
$$ K(G) := \left\\{ aba^{-1}b^{-1} : \forall a, b \in G\right\\} $$
the set of all commutators of $G.$

%{(Problem)}% Commutants of regular polygons.

1. Find the commutant of $\Z_n.$
2. Prove that the commutant of a commutative group is the trivial group.
3. Find the commutant of the group of symmetries of the triangle and the 
rectangle. In other words, find the commutants of the dihedral groups of order
$6$ and $8.$
4. *Prove that the commutant of a regular $n$-gon is $n$ for odd $n$ and $n/2$
for even $n.$
