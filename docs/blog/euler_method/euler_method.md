%{(Post "The Shortest Path Between Two Points Using Finite Differences"

I was bored on my flight to Lisbon so I decided to try this. It is, in 
reality, the solution to problem 1 of Gelfand and Fomin's *Calculus of 
Variations*. I couldn't get Mathematica to export the notebook nicely to
html so I hope the following pdf and Mathematica notebook will suffice.

<object class="pdf"

The notebook can be found [here](finitediff.nb).
