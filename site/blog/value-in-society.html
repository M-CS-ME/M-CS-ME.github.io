<h1 style="text-align: left; font-size: 20pt;">Difficulties with Supply and Demand</h1>


<p> July 2022 <br></br></p>

<p><b>Definition 1.</b> Value is a measure of how much an object or activity 
   increases or decreases happiness/satisfaction.</p>




<p><b>Observation 1.</b> Supply and demand is the primary heuristic by which society
   determines the value of objects and actions.</p>




<p><b>Observation 2.</b> The demand for an object or activity is determined by what the
   consumer <i>precieves</i> as it's actual value. This preception is often 
   incorrent. The quote that comes to mind is</p>


<blockquote><p>If I&rsquo;d asked the customers what they wanted they would&rsquo;ve said faster
horses<a href="#footnote-1"><sup id="source-1">[1]</sup></a></p></blockquote>

<p><b>Observation 3.</b> The demand for an object or an activity can be tampered with.
   This is done by <i>convincing</i> people that something, which may or may
   not be worthless, is valuable.</p>




<p><b>Definition 2.</b> Inflation is when the assigned societal value of an object or
   activity is higher than it's utility value. Similar such definitions can be
   given for under and overvaluations.</p>




<p><b>Proposition 1.</b> People seek <i>power over people</i>. This is because one can
   use power over people to tamper with demand and hence artificially increase
   one's own wealth. We can see that this causes inflation.</p>




<p><b>Proposition 2.</b> People are misdirected from searching for happiness. They are
   usually mistaken about the value of objects lim_and activities, and confusing
   societal value and actual value, they search for the former in hopes of 
   acquiring the latter. Therefore people search for what will not necessarily
   benefit them.</p>


<p>Well that&rsquo;s my view on value and society. However there are several problems
with this: There is not enough experimental evidence to outright confirm this,
and designing any experiment to confirm or deny any of the following
observations or propositions is difficult. Not to mention the carrying out
of the experiment.</p>

<p><br></br> <br></br> <br></br> <b>Notes</b> <ol><li><p id="footnote-1">I know that this is a myth, however I do think the general
sentiment is true. For example, tech ethusiasts love to get
excited about the new faster CPU, rarely for things that
radically improve computing such as work being done by Bret
Victor and friends.</p></li></ol></p>
