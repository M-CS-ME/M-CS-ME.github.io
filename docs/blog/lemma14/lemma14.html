<h1 style="text-align: left; font-size: 20pt;">A Proof of Lemma XIV of the First Book of Newton's Principia</h1>


<p> September 2022 <br></br></p>

<center><b>Lemma XIV</b></center>


<p><em>The prependicular, let fall from the focus of a parabola on its
tangent, is a mean porportional between the distances of the focus from the
point of contact, and from the principal vertex of the figure.</em></p>

<p><img src="lemma14.png" style="max-width: 50%" align="right"></img>
Newton&rsquo;s original argument is as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>For, let $AP$ be the parabola, $S$ its focus, $A$ its principal vertex, $P$
the point of contact, $PO$ an ordinate to the principal diameter, $PM$ the
tangent meeting the principal diameter in $M$, and $SN$ the perpendicular from
the focus on the tangent. Join $AN$, and because of the equal lines $MS$ and
$SP$, $MN$ and $NP$, $MA$ and $AO$, the right lines $AN$, $OP$ will be
parallel; and thence the triangle $SAN$ will be right-angled at $A$, and
similar to the equal triangles $SNM$, $SNP$; therefore $PS$ is to $SN$ as $SN$
is to $SA$.</p></blockquote>

<p>Though this might seem perfectly convincing, it still left me with several
questions. Newton&rsquo;s argument relies on the equality of $MS$ and $SP$ as well
as the equality of $MA$ and $AO$. These he does not prove.<a href="#footnote-1"><sup id="source-1">[1]</sup></a> And within my own investigation of the problem I have only been
able to find proofs of these assumptions which utilize the fact that $NA$ is
parallel to $PO$, while Newton states that as a corrolary of the present lemma.
In this post I intend to provide a more complete demonstration of this fact and
provide sources for the theorems whose truth I take for granted.</p>

<p>To begin, let us prove the equality of $MS$ and $SP$. Let $d$ be the directrix
of our parabola $S$ be the focus, and $P$, be the point of tangency. As such,
<img src="lemma14-1.png" style="max-width: 50%" align="left"></img>
$SP = PI$ where $PI$ is perpendicular to the directrix. At this point we might
as well connect $I$ to the intersection of the tangent and the axis of symmetry,
$M$. Our resulting picture strongly suggests that $PSMI$ is a rhombus. This can
be verified by noticing that, since $MS$ and $PI$ are parallel, then
$\angle PMS = \angle IPM$, $\angle IMP = \angle MPS$, $\angle MIS = \angle ISP$,
$\angle PIS = \angle ISM$. As such $\angle PIM = \angle PSM$. Therefore, the
triangles $\triangle IPM$ and $\triangle PSM$ are congruent, as the side $MP$
is shared by the two of them. As we have shown that $IP = MS$, then it follows
that $MS = SP$. We may also deduce that $MN = PN$.</p>

<p>By this point things should be a much more clear. Of the three equalities in
Newton&rsquo;s argument, we have already proven two. But we still need to show that
$MA = AO$.
<img src="lemma14-2.png" style="max-width: 50%" align="right"></img>
Notice here that $NPOS$ is a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_quadrilateral">cyclic quadrilateral</a>.
As such, $\angle NOS$ is equal to $\angle NPS$ which is in turn equal to
$\angle NMA$.  <a href="#footnote-2"><sup id="source-2">[2]</sup></a> Therefore,
$\triangle MNO$ is isosceles and as such, $MN = NO$. Since $NA$ is shared by
the triangles $\triangle MNA$ and $\triangle ONA$, and that $NA$ is
perpendicular to $MO$, then we may deduce that $\triangle MNA$ is congruent to
$\triangle ONA$. So it is clear that $MA$ is equal to $AO$.</p>

<p>Now we have shown all three of the equalities presumed by Newton in his proof!
However, we aren&rsquo;t done yet. In showing that $MA = AO$, I assumed that the
perpendicular from $N$ meets $MO$ at the vertex. This I haven&rsquo;t proved. So join
<img src="lemma14-3.png" style="max-width: 50%" align="left"></img>
$AN$ and $CN$ where $C$ is the intersection of the axis and the directrix. Then
drop a perpendicular from $N$ to $d$ and call it $R$. Afterwards reflect $C$
over $R$ and call it $C'$. Notice that $AC$ is parallel to $NR$ and $CC'$ is
parallel to $NA$. As $CR = C'R$ and $NR$ is shared by them, $\triangle NCR$ is
congruent to $\triangle C'RN$. Notice as well that $\angle ASN = \angle RNC'$.
and since both $\angle C'RN$ and $\angle NAS$ are right angles, and that
$C'R = NA$, then $\triangle NAS \cong \triangle C'RN \cong \triangle NCR$ which
is in turn congruent to $\triangle ANC$. Therefore, $\triangle CNS$ is isosceles
and $CA = AS$. Meaning that $A$ is the midpoint of $CS$; i.e., the vertex.</p>

<p>All that remains now is to restate Newton&rsquo;s argument. Since $MS = SP$,
<img src="lemma14.png" style="max-width: 50%" align="right"></img>
$MN = NP$, and $MA = AO$, then $\triangle MNS$ is congruent to $\triangle SNP$.
The triangle $\triangle NAS$, by virtue of sharing $\angle NSA$ with
$\triangle MNS$ and having a right angle at $\angle NAS$ is similar to
$\triangle MNS$ and $\triangle SNP$. Therefore $PS$ is to $SN$, as $SN$ is to
$NA$. This completes our proof of lemma XIV of Newton&rsquo;s Principia. Q.E.D.</p>

if he&rsquo;s relying on some theorems found in Apollonius or other writers on Conics
