<center><b>Lemma XIV</b></center>
*The prependicular, let fall from the focus of a parabola on its
tangent, is a mean porportional between the distances of the focus from the 
point of contact, and from the principal vertex of the figure.*

%{(align-img "lemma14.png" "right")}%
Newton's original argument is as follows:

>For, let $AP$ be the parabola, $S$ its focus, $A$ its principal vertex, $P$
>the point of contact, $PO$ an ordinate to the principal diameter, $PM$ the 
>tangent meeting the principal diameter in $M$, and $SN$ the perpendicular from
>the focus on the tangent. Join $AN$, and because of the equal lines $MS$ and 
>$SP$, $MN$ and $NP$, $MA$ and $AO$, the right lines $AN$, $OP$ will be 
>parallel; and thence the triangle $SAN$ will be right-angled at $A$, and 
>similar to the equal triangles $SNM$, $SNP$; therefore $PS$ is to $SN$ as $SN$
>is to $SA$.

Though this might seem to be complete, upon further inspection it is clear that
Newton has left quite a lot of work for us to do. For instance, Newton's 
argument relies on the equality of $MS$ and $SP$ as well as the equality of
$MA$ and $AO$. So if we wish to complete Newton's argument, we need to prove
both of these identities. As such we have two propositions in need of proof:

1. *Given that the tangent of a parabola intersects its axis of symmetry 
at $M$, then the distance between $M$ and the focus is equal to the distance 
between the focus and the point of tangency.*

2. *Given that the tangent of a parabola intersects its axis of symmetry at 
$M$, then the distance between $M$ and the vertex is equal to the distance 
between the vertex and the perpendicular dropped from the point of tangency.*

But before we get into this, let me give an introduction to dealing with 
parabolas geometrically for those whou might not be familiar with such things.

## Parabolas from a geometric perspective

Most people know parabolas as curves traced by the functions of the form
$f(x) = a[k(x-p)]^2 + q$ where $(p, q)$ is the vertex of the parabola. Though
this representation of a parabola is very useful in a large variety of 
problems—notably those in classical mechanics—it is not a useful tool for our
current problem. The equations quickly get too unwieldy too quickly. 
Fortunately, one may also study parabolas from a geometric/synthetic 
perspective.

<center><b>Definition 1</b></center>
*Given a line $d$ and a point $F$, a parabola is defined as the shape such that
all points on the parabola are equidistant from $d$ and $F$. By convention we
call the $d$* the directrix *and $F$* the focus.

From this definition it is clear that the vertex of the parabola is the midpoint
of the line connecting the focus and the directrix. If it is not clear, then
you can prove it yourself by using the fact that the vertex is the point on the
parabola which is closest to the directrix.

It might not be totally clear how this is related to the algebraic definition.
But I'll convince you that these two definitions have all the same properties
as each other. For instance, we know that a parabola $f$ with its vertex at 
$(0,0)$ is *even*; that is $f(-x) = f(x)$. The analogous property is stated
geometrically as:

<center><b>Theorem 1</b></center>
*In any parabola, the line passing through the vertex and the focus is the axis
of symmetry. Meaning that if two points are equidistant from the line passing
through the focus and the vertex, then they are equidistant from the directrix.*

Trace a parabola with focus $F$ and a directrix through $A$ such that $AF$ is
perpendicular to the directrix. Pick any point $X_1$ on the directrix and 
reflect it over $A$ at $X_2$ and connect both to the focus. Notice that, since 
%{(align-img "theorem1.png" "right")}%
$X_1F = X_2F$, then $\angle FX_1A = \angle FX_2A$. And as $\angle Y_1X_1A$ 
and $\angle Y_2X_2A$ are right angles, then $\angle Y_1X_1F$ and 
$\angle Y_2X_2F$ are both equal to $90^\circ - \angle FX_1A$. We now use the
defining property of the parabola by observing that $\triangle X_1Y_1F$ and 
$\triangle X_2Y_2F$ are both isosceles. And since two of their angles and two
of their sides, namely $Y_1X_1F$ and $\angle Y_2X_2F$ and $X_1F$ and $X_2F$
are equal, then $\triangle X_1Y_1F \cong \triangle X_2Y_2F$. Therefore it is
clear that $Y_1X_1 = Y_2X_2$. Q.E.D.

Now you might rightfully protest and say that this isn't enough. "There are many
things other than parabolas which are symmetric", I hear you say. So now we'll
try to convert this shape onto the Cartesian coordinate system to see whether
these two definitions really are equivalent.

<center><b>Theorem 2</b></center>
*Let the vertex of the parabola be placed at the origin and let the line $y=-1$ 
be the directrix. The function that traces this parabola is $y = ax\^2$ for 
some $a$.*

Since we determined that the vertex is the midpoint of the line connecting the
focus with the axis of symmetry, then it should be clear that in our present
construction the focus is $F = (0,1)$. Let $P = (x,y)$ be on the parabola. Then
from our definition we know that $y + 1 = PF$ which is equal to
$\sqrt{|x|^2 + |y-1|^2}$. So we obtain the equation
$$
y + 1 = \sqrt{|x|^2 + |y-1|^2}
$$
Which we intend to solve for $y$. So square both sides
$$
y\^2 + 2y + 1 = x\^2 + y\^2 - 2y + 1
$$
And by isolating for $y$ we obtain: $ y = \frac{1}{4}x\^2 $. Q.E.D.

By this point you should truly be convinced of the equality of these two 
defintions. And if not, then feel free to try Newton's lemma by using algebraic
methods. Now I'll provide a sample problem to increase the reader's familiarity
with using these techniques.

<center><b>Exercise 1</b></center>
*Suppose that on a parabola with vertex $V$ and a focus $F$ there exists a 
point $A$ such that $AF = 20$ and $AV = 21$. What is the sum of all possible 
values of length $FV$.* %{(Note "This problem is from the 2021 AMC 12 A. 
<a href=\' \'>Source</a>")}%

<center><b>Goal 1</b></center>
1. *Given that the tangent of a parabola intersects its axis of symmetry at 
$M$, then the distance between $M$ and the focus is equal to the distance 
between the focus and the point of tangency.*
2. *The perpendicular dropped from the focus onto the tangent bisects the 
distance between $M$ and the point of tangency.*

Let $d$ be the directrix of our parabola $S$ be the focus, and $P$, be the 
point of tangency. As such, $SP = PI$ where $PI$ is perpendicular to the 
directrix. At this point we might as well connect $I$ to the intersection of 
the tangent and the axis of symmetry,
%{(align-img "lemma14-1.png" "left")}%
$M$. Our resulting picture strongly suggests that $PSMI$ is a rhombus. This can
be verified by noticing that, since $MS$ and $PI$ are parallel, then
$\angle PMS = \angle IPM$, $\angle IMP = \angle MPS$, $\angle MIS = \angle ISP$,
$\angle PIS = \angle ISM$. As such $\angle PIM = \angle PSM$. Therefore, the
triangles $\triangle IPM$ and $\triangle PSM$ are congruent, as the side $MP$
is shared by the two of them. As we have shown that $IP = MS$, then it follows
that $MS = SP$. We may also deduce that $MN = PN$. Q.E.D.

By this point things should be a much more clear. Of the three equalities in
Newton's argument, we have already proven two. But we still need to show that
$MA = AO$.

<center><b>Goal 2</b></center>
*Given that the tangent of a parabola intersects its axis of symmetry at $M$,
then the distance between $M$ and the vertex is equal to the distance between
the vertex and the perpendicular dropped from the point of tangency.*

Notice here that $NPOS$ is a 
%{(align-img "lemma14-2.png" "right")}%
[cyclic quadrilateral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_quadrilateral).
As such, $\angle NOS$ is equal to $\angle NPS$ which is in turn equal to 
$\angle NMA$.  %{(Note "Cyclic quadrilaterals are quadrilaterals which have two 
right angles which are opposite to each other. They also have the rather nice 
property that the angle made by a side and any diagonal is equal to the angle 
made by the opposite side and the other diagonal.")}% Therefore, 
$\triangle MNO$ is isosceles and as such, $MN = NO$. Since $NA$ is shared by 
the triangles $\triangle MNA$ and $\triangle ONA$, and that $NA$ is 
perpendicular to $MO$, then we may deduce that $\triangle MNA$ is congruent to 
$\triangle ONA$. So it is clear that $MA$ is equal to $AO$.

Now we have shown all three of the equalities presumed by Newton in his proof!
However, we aren't done yet. In showing that $MA = AO$, I assumed that the 
perpendicular from $N$ meets $MO$ at the vertex. This I haven't proved. So join
%{(align-img "lemma14-3.png" "left")}%
$AN$ and $CN$ where $C$ is the intersection of the axis and the directrix. Then
drop a perpendicular from $N$ to $d$ and call it $R$. Afterwards reflect $C$ 
over $R$ and call it $C'$. Notice that $AC$ is parallel to $NR$ and $CC'$ is
parallel to $NA$. As $CR = C'R$ and $NR$ is shared by them, $\triangle NCR$ is
congruent to $\triangle C'RN$. Notice as well that $\angle ASN = \angle RNC'$.
and since both $\angle C'RN$ and $\angle NAS$ are right angles, and that 
$C'R = NA$, then $\triangle NAS \cong \triangle C'RN \cong \triangle NCR$ which
is in turn congruent to $\triangle ANC$. Therefore, $\triangle CNS$ is isosceles
and $CA = AS$. Meaning that $A$ is the midpoint of $CS$; i.e., the vertex.

All that remains now is to restate Newton's argument. Since $MS = SP$,
%{(align-img "lemma14.png" "right")}%
$MN = NP$, and $MA = AO$, then $\triangle MNS$ is congruent to $\triangle SNP$.
The triangle $\triangle NAS$, by virtue of sharing $\angle NSA$ with 
$\triangle MNS$ and having a right angle at $\angle NAS$ is similar to 
$\triangle MNS$ and $\triangle SNP$. Therefore $PS$ is to $SN$, as $SN$ is to
$NA$. This completes our proof of lemma XIV of Newton's Principia. Q.E.D.
